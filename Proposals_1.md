# Capstone Proposals #1

1.  Some Spare Time
    a.  After nearly a decade working in the music retail industry, trends surrounding sales of 'luxury items' such as instruments are a familiar, yet interesting subject to me. In this project, I will inspect how the sales of common hobbyist musical instruments (typically fretted stringed instruments, as well as keyboards and drum sets/world percussion) have changed during the Coronavirus pandemic.
    b.  How were sales of musical instruments impacted by the global Coronavirus pandemic?

2.  A Gathering of Data
    a.  Wizards of the Coast's classic 1993 trading card game `Magic: the Gathering` has been a part of my life since a young age. As a comptitive player, other players' deck construction choices have always been of interest to me. In this project I will inspect distributions of card choices, as well as ratios of card types and converted mana costs among deck sub- and super-types.
    b.  What similarities in construction can be found between competitive MTG decks?

3.  Age of Analysis II
    a.  `Age of Empires II` is a real-time strategy PC game developed and released by Microsoft in 1999 which still enjoys popularity today. So much so, in fact, that recent years have seen large international tournaments sonsored by names such as Red Bull, and even a remaster & brand new content from Microsoft. In this project I will inspect how recent spikes in popularity affected players' choices of civilazations as well as their rankings in online competitive play.
    b.  How were players' in-game choices and competitive ratings affected by increases in popularity of Age of Empires II?
